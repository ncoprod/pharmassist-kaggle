# PharmAssist AI — Kaggle MedGemma Impact Challenge

Synthetic-only demo application for the **Kaggle MedGemma Impact Challenge (2026)**.

Key principles:
- Uses **MedGemma / HAI-DEF** models (mandatory for Kaggle).
- Demonstrates an **agentic workflow** (tool-calling + trace).
- **No real patient data**. Synthetic data only.

## Quick Start (WIP)

This repo is being built right now. Initial setup will be documented here as we implement the demo.

## License

This repository is open source (see `LICENSE`).
